# How to use the Asset pipeline
</section>
<section>
## Where do assets belong?

* `/public`
* `app/assets/...` — **your** code/images/fonts
* `lib/assets/...` — **your** support code/files, extensions to vendor libs
* `vendor/assets/...` — everything you don't own

</section>
<section>
  <p>Or define/add your own:</p>
  <pre>
    <code class="ruby" data-trim>
config.assets.paths << Rails.root.join("lib", "videoplayer", "flash")
    </code>
  </pre>

via:

* `application.rb`
* `environments/*.rb`
* `config/initializer/assets.rb`*

<small>*introduced in Rails 4 but you can backport to Rails 3</small>
</section>
<section>
## Types of assets

* fonts (`assets/fonts/`)
* images (`assets/images/`)
* audio/video
* JavaScript (`assets/javascripts/`)
* CSS (`assets/stylesheets/`)
* templates (Mustache, Handlebars, …)*

<small>*usually different path outside <code class="inline">assets/…</code>
due to use in back-end + front-end</small>
</section>
<section>
## Use/reference via

* `//= require library_name` (JavaScript, CSS*)
* `@import` (Sass)
* `asset_tag`, `image_tag`, `audio_tag`, `video_tag`, `font_tag`
* `asset_path`/`asset_url` and specialized helpers
* `asset-path`/`asset-url` and specialized helpers for CSS/Sass

<div class="fragment">
In your templates

~~~ erb
<%= stylesheet_link_tag "application", …, media: "all" %>
<%= javascript_include_tag "application", … %>
<%= image_tag "meetup.jpg", alt: "…" %>
<img src="<%= image_path 'meetup.jpg' %>" alt="…"/>
~~~

</div>
</section>
<section>
## require vs. @import

Rails Guides:

> If you want to use multiple Sass files, you should generally use the Sass @import rule
> instead of these Sprockets directives. When using Sprockets directives, Sass files exist within
> their own scope, making variables or mixins only available within the document they were defined in.

<div class="fragment">
In practice that means:

* `@import` is globally evaluated
* `require` is locally (file context) evaluated
</div>

Huh…?

<section>
Example:

~~~ sass
/* variables.scss */
$main-color: #ABC;

/* user.scss */
.user {
  .button {
    background-color: $main-color; // BOOM!
  }
}

/* application.scss (manifest) */
/*
*= require 'variables' // scope of 'variables' ends here
*= require 'user'
*/
~~~

<section>
CSS is 'global', so is using `@import`

`require` is cleaner but you have to require what you need. Beware, requiring
the same file (from different files) can result in duplicate CSS!
</section>
<section>

  * `require`
  * `require_tree path`
  * `require_self`

</section>
<section>
# What's a manifest?

* usually `application.js`/`application.scss` (pre-compiled)
* pre-compile others via adding them to `config/initializers/assets.rb`

~~~ruby
Rails.application.config.assets.precompile += ['admin.js', 'admin.css']
~~~

## more general

* files which contain directives like `require`/`@import`, that is, files which
  pull in/define dependencies (think Gemfile, multiple)
* only manifest files from `config.assets.precompile` array are pre-compiled
  automatically

# How to Bower?

Easy, just use [https://rails-assets.org/](https://rails-assets.org/), seriously!

* converts Bower packages to gems
* converts URLs to `asset-path(...)`
* it'll tell you the path to use with `require`/`@import`

Example: in your Gemfile...

~~~ruby
# Libraries
gem 'jquery-rails'
gem 'sass-rails'
# ...

source 'https://rails-assets.org' do
  gem 'rails-assets-BOWER_PACKAGE_NAME'
end
~~~
